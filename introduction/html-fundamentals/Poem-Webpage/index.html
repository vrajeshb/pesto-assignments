</head>
<body>

    <!-- First stanza -->
    <p>I'm Nobody! Who are you?<br>
    Are you - Nobody - Too?<br>
    Then there's a pair of us!<br>
    Don't tell! They'd banish us - you know!</p>

    <!-- Second stanza -->
    <p>How dreary - to be - Somebody!<br>
    How public - like a Frog -<br>
    To tell one's name - the livelong June - To an admiring Bog!</p>

    <!-- Author and date -->
    <p>By <em>Emily Dickinson</em> (<time datetime="1891">1891</time>)</p>
